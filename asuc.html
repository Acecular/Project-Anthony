      "The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is the officially
      recognized student association at the University of California, Berkeley. Known as one of
      the largest and most autonomous student organizations in the nation, the ASUC is an
      independent 501(c)3 nonprofit organization separate from University governance. In
      addition to controlling funding for student clubs and organizations, providing resources and
      student programming, overseeing commercial activities and student services including
      the Cal Student Store and Lower Sproul Plaza in partnership with the ASUC Student Union, the
      ASUC advocates for students on a University, local, state, and national level and represents
      the student body on administrative campus committees."

          <p>I continued this semester as the Director of Accountability in the
            Office of Accountability. We began this semester with a launching of our
            new website at <a class="two" href ="https://accountability.asuc.org/" target="_blank">
              accountability.asuc.org </a>. It was developed by our Director of
              Operations and maintains an efficient and organized location for all of
              the Association officials' reports. Previously, there was a problem accessing
              archived reports but I believe that with this new system that this problem
              can be solved. Officials could submit reports through
              this system and a punctuality chart is also shown regarding the timeliness
              of each officials' report. This proved more effective than the Google Forms
              we used last semester and provided easier public access. With elections season,
              the Accountability Office played a role in maintaining a just and fair election.
              Bylaws were enforced by our office in preserving the integrity of the ASUC
              elections. Students were encouraged to report any violations to our office
              and we also played an active role in closely monitoring campaigns. Measures were taken and
              enforced by the Accountability Office, the Legal Office, and the Elections Council with
              all decisions handled by the Judicial Council of the ASUC.

            <p> This semester I had the privilege of being in the Office of Accountability
              as the Director of Accountability. My goals were to primarily
              enforce attendance at committee and Senate meetings. I made sure weekly
              and bi-weekly reports were submitted for executive officials, appointed officials, and senators that
              accurately reflected what our officials were doing for the student body/campus. These
              reports were then compiled into a centralized location and made public as part
              of the ASUC Transparency Initiative Projecy. Along with the Chief Accountability Officer, I took part in meetings
              with officials regarding performance and progress on the platforms they
              ran their elections on.
              I also sat in on Governance and Internal Affairs and Senate Meetings
              to discuss Senate Resolutions, interviewed potential nominees for Judicial Council
              and ensured that elected officials were held accountable for what they promised to the students.
              At the end of the semester, I helped gather and arrange
              the stipends for the 40+ association officials based on their performance throughout the semester.
              The mid-year report was also due to our office at the end of the semester.
            </p>
              <p> Below are some relevant links relating to the twenty senators' attendance and all
                the elected/appointed officials' reports that I have been involved in this semester.
                These files are public and can also be found on the ASUC Central Drive.
