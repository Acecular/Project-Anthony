          <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting and welcome to my website! I am currently a senior attending the University of California, 
            Berkeley majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology. My goal is to study and practice medicine with an empahsis on thorough and 
            compassionate care.
           </p>
           <p> As a student of UC Berkeley, I am involved in a variety of extracurricular activities that I am
             passionate about. 
           </p>
          <p> An organization I am apart of is the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) which is the largest and most autonomous student
            association in the country. Starting in August 2016, I have served as the Director of Accountability.
            Our office strives to hold all elected and appointed
            officials accountable for their actions, platforms, and duties to the student body. We work closely
            with the Chief Legal Officer/Attorney General and the Judicial Council to maintain and enforce internal
            accountability within the ASUC and the student body. Every week, I also verify that all executive officers,
            appointed officials, senators, and commission chairs keep up with their attendance at committee and Senate
            meetings as well as outreach requirements. Weekly reports and mid-year reports are also due to our office
            where we review the elected officials' activities and accomplishments during their terms to ensure that
            they have been continually productive. Through these reports, our office also spearheads the ASUC Transparency
            Initiative Project by providing public access to ASUC official documents which include
            financial records, performance reviews, ASUC archives, and weekly reports.
          </p>
          <p> One of the greatest joys of being a part of the Berkeley community is to give back to the community around us.
            At Cal, I am a part of the Oakland Asian Student Education Services (OASES) where I spend four hours a week tutoring
            and mentoring a class of underprivileged students at Lincoln Elementary School as a volunteer. I help them with
            homework, learning, and goal-setting. I review concepts which may have given them trouble in school and
            help them to learn the material instead of giving them the answers. In Fall 2016, I mentored a group of
            fifth graders. It is one of my greatest joys to see these young children grow from the first day
            I mentored them to now. I know that they will one day grow up to be successful and giving people. I also regularly
            participate in the Berkeley Project which is a large scale community service throughout the city of Berkeley.
          </p>
          <p> When I am back home in Fremont, California, I enjoy doing a variety of activities that keep me connected with my local 
            community. I regularly volunteer at Washington Hospital. I am also regularly at ClubSport Fremont where I
            serve as a lifeguard and am a USA Swimming coach for the Flying Fish Swim Team.
          </p>
          <p> Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and I hope you have a wonderful day! Please <a class="two" href="/form">contact</a> or
            <a class="two" href="mailto:a.yeung@berkeley.edu">email</a> me if I could be of any assistance!
