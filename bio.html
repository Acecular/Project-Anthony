          <p>Hi! I am an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. As a member of the Berkeley 
            community, I am involved with the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), the 
            largest and most autonomous student government in the country. One of the highlights of my week as
            a student is also being able to mentor under-served children in Oakland as part of the EBAYC, Oakland Asian
            Student Educational Services (OASES).
           </p>
           <p> Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have a deep commitment to the people of the local community. 
             I graduated from Mission San Jose High School where I swam varsity for four years and was a year-round
             club swimmer for many years. Now, after many years, I continue to be around the pool but on the pool
             deck where I continue my love of swimming: coaching younger swimmers.
           </p>
          <p> If I can help in any way, please do not hesitate to <a class="two" href="mailto:a.yeung@berkeley.edu">email</a> me.
          </p>
